This is more like two addition features but they go hand in hand together so they will go together here as a new feature. My new features allow for new types of edits for the line tools and shape tools. The first of the two features is a line cap selection feature. On the toolbar, there is a choice box allowing you to choose from 3 different types of line cap. These are the built in Java caps which are square, round, and butt. This however only works on the line tools which include pencil and line. The next feature applies to both line and shape tools which is line dash. On the toolbar, there is an editable combo box of floats which can change the line dash width. This adds a nice option for the shape and line tools on the user's masterpiece. There is one quirk that I fixed. The quirk that occurred was that when the outline width was the same value as the dash width, the line would not dash which makes sense. I fixed this so the program detects this and adds one to the dash width allowing it to have a line dash automatically if the value is not zero and the outline width and line dash are the same value.
