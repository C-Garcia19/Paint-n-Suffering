The new feature I implemented was rotate. There are several options a user can choose from for rotate like rotate right 90, rotate left 90, rotate 180, flip vertically, and flip horizontally. These options apply to the canvas and changes its orientation. This is useful for making edits to the canvas from a different perspective allowing for somethings to be more easily drawn. There is also a reset rotate button which undos all the rotates on the canvas and puts it back to its normal orientation.
